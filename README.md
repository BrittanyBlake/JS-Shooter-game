<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a 2D browser-based shooter game built with Phaser 3. The main character is a witch who gets attacked by a magic troll and his foxes trying to stop them from collectiong coins. For every coin collected, you will get 10 points and in the end you can see how you compare to other users. 

When the game loads, you will be taken to a screen with 4 options:
* Play => this takes you to the screen with the instructions. After reading the instructions you can choose to go back to the main menu or to start the game
* Options => from here, you can enable or disable the music/sound. 
* Credits => You can see the desgin details and contributions.
* Leaderboard => from here, you can see the users with the top scores and try to beat their scores

<!-- Game Design -->
## Game Design
* I used [this](https://pipoya.itch.io/pipoya-free-2d-game-character-sprites
) sprite pack from Pipoya for the animations 
* I used [this](https://marwamj.itch.io/grass-plain-vector-2d-game-background
) pack from Marwam for the parallax background effect.
* I used [this](https://muhammadriza.itch.io/free-fantasy-rpg-music-pack?download) music pack from Muhammad Riza for the sound
